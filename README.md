this is just a simple script to install windows .wim files automaticly without the hassle of typing each commands.

this batch script works on Windows Vista PE up to Windows 11 PE (recommended to use a actual PE disc instead of the PE of windows installer)

Requirements:
1. Windows PE iso (recommended that its cleaned, removing the install.wim/install.esd inside the sources folder)
2. a Windows .wim file (just put it on the iso where the setup.bat is)
3. wimlib imagex 1.8.3 (download on: https://wimlib.net/downloads/wimlib-1.8.3-windows-i686-bin.zip)
4. Text editor (notepad can work but notepad++ is recommended)
